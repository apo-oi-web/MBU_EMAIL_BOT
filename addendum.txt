<p>MBU Parents and Scouts!</p>
<p>We forgot to mention in the last email that we will be providing cheese pizza for lunch and a salad for those with dietary restrictions.</p>
<p>In addition, for those who require parking please park in the Gateway parking lot (12 Washburn Way - Worcester, MA 01609). If so, please print out the attached parking pass and place it visibly on your dashboard. Please note, that you must walk to the drop off location. </p>
<p>Finally, please remember to fill out the minors on campus form.</p>

<p>Best,</p>
<p>~MBU Committee</p>
