Hello ${PERSON_NAME},

We have had problems with emails getting sent to spam this year, so we are sending this email to confirm that you are assigned the following badges:

	1. ${PERIOD1}   (9am-11am)
	2. ${PERIOD2}   (12pm-2pm)
	3. ${PERIOD3}   (2pm-4pm)

You should have received an email saying that you were added to group alias for all badges you've been assigned. Make sure that the badges listed above are the same as the alias you were added to.

YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DOWNLOAD ANYTHING. These aliases are meant for instructors to reach out to you, which they will in the upcoming days. Please DO NOT email the aliases unless it's something that the whole class needs to know.

As always, please reach out to mbu@wpi.edu with any questions. We are excited to have you join us at WPI on November 9th and December 7th for our annual Merit Badge University!
Remember that check-ins are from 8-9am on both days. Stay tuned for blue card, maps, parking and other day of info.

If you are a troop leader or parent, please forward this information to your scout.

Please use this time in the coming weeks to complete any prerequisites your badge may have before the first day of MBU.
Prerequisites can be found here: https://users.wpi.edu/~apo/MBU/Prerequisites_MBU_2019.pdf


Thank you,
The MBU Committee
